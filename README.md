## Getting Started with Create React App
`npx create-react-app react-typescript --template typescript`

Will the file contain a React component, or any kind of JSX? -> Use the extension '.tsx'

NoJSX? -> Use '.ts'

## Using Typescript with React
That's great, but not to much is going to change:
- Applying types to component props
- Applying types to state in a component
- Types with event handlers
- ...Several other assorted areas
